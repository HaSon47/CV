# CV
- ViT: This folder just have code to run pretrained ViT model. However, it doesn't have evaluate functions
- ViT_ver2: new release of ViT folder. Which has evaluate functions and added ViT_from_scratch model. Moreover, its code is more clean then the old version.
# Problem
- split_data: \sum(ptu * batch_size * num_batch(train, val, test))> len(dataset)
- output.logit 
- val def and test def is duplicate
